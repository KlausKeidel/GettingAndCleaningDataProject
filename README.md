You should create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
   
   * Merges the training and the test set to create one data set.
   * Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   * Uses descriptive activity names to the activities in the data set.
   * Appropiately labels the data set with decriptive variable names.
   * From the data set in Step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each suvject.
   
#### Workingsteps:

  * Download the data source an unzip the file unzip the file on your local drive.
  * Create the run_analysis.R script.
  * Run the script to generate the new file with the tidy-data's.
  * Write the markdown Codebook file.
  * Push everything up to Github
